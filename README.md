# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Problem Statement
In this project a bank marketing [dataset](<https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv>) is used.
It contains phone calls from a direct marketing compaign of a Portoguese banking institution.

The dataset has a series of information (age, job, marital, education, etc...) for a total of 32950 observations, 20 features, and a target variable (y)
with two possible values: yes or no.
The task is addressed as a classification task and the goal is to predict if a client will subscribe a term deposit (y variable).

Two different approaches have been investigated. The first one use a logistic regression model with hyperparameters tuning using HyperDrive,
the second one use the power of AutoML.

The main steps are reported in the diagram below:

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
** Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm. **

In this first task, an HyperDrive pipeline using a scikit-learn logistic regression model is built.

The *train.py* script contains the following steps:

  - Load data as TabularDataset using TabularDatasetFactory
  - Transform and clean data: the clean_data() function is used for handle missing values, create dummies variables for categorical features, mapping values and other transformations in order to make data suitable for modeling
  - Split data into train and test set: 80% train, 20% test
  - Train the logistic regression model on training data with two hyperparameters:
  
    - C: inverse of regularization strength. Smaller values cause stronger regularization
    - max_iter: maximum number of iterations for model to converge
    
    The goal is to tune these two parameters using HyperDrive.

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used when the dipendent variable (y) is categorical. It uses the logistic function to model the probability of a certain class or event (yes or no).
